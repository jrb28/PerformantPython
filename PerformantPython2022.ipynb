    "# Goals of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn:\n",
    "- How to effectively iterate through elements in data structures\n",
    "  - <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loop\n",
    "- How to access data programmatically\n",
    "- Useful Python functions and techniques\n",
    "- Python skills for large data sets\n",
    "- Skills for readable programming code\n",
    "- How to measure code speed and memory usage\n",
    "  - ... in order to increase speed and reduce memory usage\n",
    "  \n",
    "While the <font face='courier'>numpy</font> and <font face='courier'>pandas</font> packages have utilities for inputting data into <code>arrays</code> and <code>DataFrames</code>, respectively, programmers need to often input data files with base Python statements, and so we will demonstrate how to do that.  This knowledge is also essential for understanding what <font face='courier'>numpy</font> and <font face='courier'>pandas</font> are doing under the covers.   In addition, data input provides a good opportunity for gaining experience with <code>for</code> loops which you will use in virtually every program you write.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, while the <font face='courier'>numpy</font> and <font face='courier'>pandas</font> packages ease data acquisition, they hide important details from you which are very important to know.  So, if you understand how to input data with base Python, then you will be in a better position to troubleshoot problems you might have with inputting data with <font face='courier'>numpy</font> and <font face='courier'>pandas</font>.\n",
